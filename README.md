# Stock Market Predictor

This project is a **Stock Market Price Prediction** application using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model, built with Python and Streamlit. The app allows users to select a stock ticker, specify a prediction timeframe, and generate predictions of stock prices. It utilizes historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, processes it with LSTM, and plots the predicted and actual stock prices along with other insights like moving averages.

## Features

- **Stock Prediction**: Users can select a stock symbol and specify a time frame (1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month, 1 Year) for price predictions.
- **Visualizations**: Displays stock price predictions against actual prices, moving averages, and future predictions.
- **Model**: The app uses a deep learning model (LSTM) to predict the future prices based on historical data.
- **Moving Averages**: Plots 50, 100, and 200 day moving averages.

## Requirements

To run this application, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- yfinance

To install the required libraries, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn keras tensorflow yfinance
```

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-predictor.git
cd stock-market-predictor
```

### 2. Run the Streamlit Application

Once all the dependencies are installed, run the app using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local server, and you can access the app by navigating to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

### 3. Interact with the App

- **Stock Selection**: From the dropdown menu, select the stock ticker you want to predict. The app uses Yahoo Finance to fetch stock data.
- **Timeframe Selection**: Choose a prediction timeframe (1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month, 1 Year).
- **Prediction**: Click the "Predict" button to generate predictions. The app will display the stock's actual vs predicted prices, future predictions, and moving averages for better insights.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Stock data is fetched using `yfinance` from Yahoo Finance for the past 5 years.
   - The stockâ€™s closing price is used to train the model.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The data is scaled using `MinMaxScaler` to normalize the prices between 0 and 1.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets, where 80% of the data is used for training, and the rest is used for testing.

3. **Model Training**:
   - A deep learning model using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** is built with Keras.
   - The model is trained for 5 epochs using the training data.

4. **Prediction**:
   - After training, the model predicts future stock prices based on the test data.
   - The predictions are then transformed back to their original scale using the inverse transformation of `MinMaxScaler`.

5. **Visualization**:
   - **Actual vs Predicted Price**: A graph comparing the actual stock prices with the predicted prices for the test period.
   - **Future Predictions**: A graph that shows the predicted stock prices for the selected future timeframe.
   - **Moving Averages**: Plots 50, 100, and 200 day moving averages along with the actual closing price to identify trends.

## Example Output

- **Predicted Stock Price**: The predicted stock price for the selected stock at the end of the selected prediction period (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, etc.).
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: The MAPE value indicates how accurate the model's predictions are. A lower MAPE indicates better performance.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Another metric to measure the performance of the model.

## Limitations

- **Data Quality**: The model relies on historical data and may not account for sudden market changes, such as major news events or financial reports.
- **Short Timeframes**: Predictions for shorter timeframes may be less accurate due to the nature of stock market volatility.
- **Model Complexity**: The LSTM model used here is relatively simple and might not capture all the complexities of stock market behavior. Further improvements can include adding more features (like technical indicators) or using more sophisticated models.

## Future Improvements

- Implement additional features like technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) for better predictions.
- Use more complex models like **GRU** (Gated Recurrent Unit) or **Transformer** models.
- Enhance the user interface with more interactive charts and options.
